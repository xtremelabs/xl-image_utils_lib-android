CHANGE LOG

v1.1
- URIs can now refer to files on disk. These images will be cached in the memory cache.
- A utility has been added called the ImagePrecacheAssistant. It can be used to rapidly implement precaching in adapters. Please note this is an early version that may undergo heavy API changes in the near future.
- The SampleSize calculation code has been completely re-written. The image system now loads images significantly faster and uses less memory when large images are being loaded into smaller views.
- A new option called "ScalingPreference" has been added. This option allows developers to choose what logic is used when scaling down images.
- A new option called "preferedConfig" has been added. This option allows developers to change the pixel format of decoded bitmaps.
- An API was added that allows developers to stub their own network libraries into the image system.
- The ImageLoader Javadoc has been updated. The Javadoc comments should now more accurately describe the functionality of API calls.
- Unit test coverage has been expanded.
- Refactored some of the system's internals. Future patches should take less time to develop.
- Bug fixes.

v1.0
- The image library is now stable.
